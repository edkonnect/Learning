At 1)Adam’s party, the number of balloons inflated (12) varied directly with the number of balloons popped before the party even began (8).
 How many balloons will pop before Adam’s next party if he inflates 36 balloons?

The number of word problems a math teacher assigns varies directly with the number of questions she is asked during class. She assigned 6 word problems on Monday after 15 questions were asked. 
If 20 questions were asked on Wednesday, how many word problems did she assign?

Phillip can paint y square feet of wall per minute. What area of the wall can he paint in 2.5 hours?


the value of y varies directly with the square of xand the cube of z. If y=24 when x=1 and z=2, then what is the value of y when x=3 and z=1?

The length of a violin string varies inversely as the frequency of its vibrations. A violin string 14 inches long vibrates at a frequency of 450 cycles per second. Find the frequency of a 12 -inch violin string.



very minute Phillip completes another y square feet of painting. To solve for the total area that he completes, we need to find the number of minutes that he works.

There are 60 minutes in an hour, and he paints for 2.5 hours. Multiply to find the total number of minutes.

(60minhr)(2.5hr)=150min

If he completes y square feet per minute, then we can multiply y by the total minutes to find the final answer.

(yft2min)(150min)=150y ft2


Let's consider the general case when y varies directly with x. If y varies directly with x, then we can express their relationship to one another using the following formula:

y = kx, where k is a constant.

Therefore, if y varies directly as the square of x and the cube of z, we can write the following analagous equation:

y = kx2z3, where k is a constant.

The problem states that y = 24 when x = 1 and z = 2. We can use this information to solve for k by substituting the known values for y, x, and z.

24 = k(1)2(2)3 = k(1)(8) = 8k

24 = 8k

Divide both sides by 8.

3 = k

k = 3

Now that we have k, we can find y if we know x and z. The problem asks us to find y when x = 3 and z = 1. We will use our formula for direct variation again, this time substitute values for k, x, and z.

y = kx2z3

y = 3(3)2(1)3 = 3(9)(1) = 27

y = 27

The answer is 27
